# Abstracted Interpreter

The code follows the 2003 tutorial by Daniel P. Friedman and Anurag Mendhekar
on _Using an Abstracted Interpreter to Understand Abstract Interpretation_
([PDF](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/l/www/classes/b621/abiall.pdf)).

A 2017 paper following a similar but more principled approach is
_Abstracting Definitional Interpreters_ by Darais et al.
([PDF](http://david.darais.com/assets/papers/abstracting-definitional-interpreters/adi.pdf),
[code](https://github.com/plum-umd/abstracting-definitional-interpreters)).
